OpenDCX Version History
=======================

Version 2.2.2 - March 1 2017
    - Partial subpixel-coverage flags extended to store a coverage weight
    - DeepFlags class broken out to better support partial spcoverage bits
    - DeepPixel flattening algorithm refined to support additive partial spcoverages
    - DeepTransform now supports partial spcoverage weights
    - DeepTransform now supports forward and backwards projection methods
    - 'spmask' channel name definitions changed to work around Nuke 10 limitations
    - PixelTile base class created to support generic rectangular pixel regions
    - ImageFormat created to support formal Format definitions stored in OpenEXR metadata
    - Nuke plugins updated - lots of bug fixes / mistakes / cleanups taken care of

Version 2.2.0 - July 21 2016 (initial public release)
    - Channel support system similar to Nuke's providing channel loop macros and boolean channel set operations (ChannelSet)
    - Primary flattening algorithm with linear/log interpolation, matte cutout and subpixel mask support (DeepPixel)
    - Simple 2D transform class supporting resampling of subpixel masks and subpixel filtering
