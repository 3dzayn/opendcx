opendcx_examples is a collection of C++ example commands that use the
OpenDCX API to illustrate common tasks.

    readDeepPixelExample.cpp:
        A simple command that reads an input deep pixel and prints
        information about its samples (DeepSegments) including the
        subpixel mask patterns.
        Illustrates a simple use of the DeepPixel class.

    deepTransformExample.cpp:
        A command which applies a 2D affine transform to all deep pixels with
        subpixel mask resampling. It illustrates use of the DeepTransform
        class.

    microPolyAccumulator.cpp, microPolyAccumulator.h:
        Example sample collapsing (accumulate) code for a micropolygon
        renderer. This does not compile into a standalone command and
        is included for reference purposes.

    raySampleAccumulatorExample.cpp:
        A command that converts input deep pixels into spheres which are
        then ray traced producing output deep pixels. An simple example
        of collapsing (accumulating) subpixel ray intersections together
        to form a single output deep sample with an accumulated subpixel
        mask.
